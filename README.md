Day 1

I began my internship by learning what I had to do: build a movie ticket booking website. I listed out the features I wanted, like showing movies, viewing movie details, booking tickets, selecting seats, and creating an admin panel to manage movies.


Day 2

I drew a rough sketch of how my website will have a homepage, movie details page, seat booking, and admin panel. It helped me visualize the structure.

Day 3

I created folders for my project and added HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. I also installed Node.js and Express to set up my backend and created a sample movies.json file.

Day 4

I designed the homepage using HTML and CSS. I added a few hardcoded movie cards to test how they look on the screen.

Day 5

I created the movie.html page to show the full details of a selected movie. I also added some sample content for now.

Day 6

I started building the backend using Node.js and Express. I created APIs to send movie data from the movies.json file to the frontend.

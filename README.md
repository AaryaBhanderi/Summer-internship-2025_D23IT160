Day 1

I began my internship by learning what I had to do: build a movie ticket booking website. I listed out the features I wanted, like showing movies, viewing movie details, booking tickets, selecting seats, and creating an admin panel to manage movies.

Day 2

I drew a rough sketch of how my website will have a homepage, movie details page, seat booking, and admin panel. It helped me visualize the structure.

Day 3

I created folders for my project and added HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. I also installed Node.js and Express to set up my backend and created a sample movies.json file.

Day 4

I designed the homepage using HTML and CSS. I added a few hardcoded movie cards to test how they look on the screen.

Day 5

I created the movie.html page to show the full details of a selected movie. I also added some sample content for now.

Day 6

I started building the backend using Node.js and Express. I created APIs to send movie data from the movies.json file to the frontend.

Day 7

I connected the frontend with the backend using fetch() in JavaScript. Now, the movie list on the homepage is coming from the backend.

Day 8

I made the movie cards dynamic. They now display based on the data from the backend. Clicking a card takes the user to the movie details page.

Day 9

I worked on movie.html to show details of the selected movie using URL parameters and JavaScript. I also added showtime selection.

Day 10

I built the seat selection layout using buttons for seats. Clicking on a seat changes its color to show it’s selected.

Day 11

I made a booking summary page that shows movie name, showtime, selected seats, and total cost after seat selection.

Day 12

I created login and signup pages. I used localStorage to store user information since I’m not using a real database.

Day 13

I used CSS media queries to make the website look good on phones and tablets. Now it’s responsive.

Day 14

I tested the site like a user. I clicked all buttons, tested the forms, and fixed small layout issues and bugs.

Day 15

I worked on improving the backend. I made sure /movies and /movies/:id APIs return correct data by reading from the JSON file.

Day 16

I added a new API for booking. It stores selected seats and movie info into a JSON file when a user confirms booking.

Day 17

I updated the system to remember booked seats and show them as unavailable next time the same movie is booked.

Day 18

Now the booking logic is working properly. Once seats are booked, they can’t be selected again.

Day 19

I added a "My Bookings" section where users can see their past bookings, based on the user logged in using localStorage.

Day 20

I cleaned up my JavaScript code, removed unused parts, and added checks to show errors if users skip steps like not choosing seats.

Day 21

I tested my backend APIs using Postman to make sure all responses are correct. I fixed a few bugs in the movie booking logic.

Day 22

I created a simple admin login page. If the admin enters the correct password, it shows the admin dashboard.

Day 23

I built a form in the admin panel to add new movies. The form adds movie data into the movies.json file.

Day 24

I updated movie data structure to support showtimes and added features for the admin to manage them.

Day 25

I created a fake payment form. It simulates the payment process and shows "Payment Successful" after a few seconds.

Day 26

After payment, I showed a booking confirmation message with all details. I also added a "Download Ticket" button.

Day 27

I added a search bar on the homepage so users can search for a movie by name. I also added a genre filter.

Day 28

I did a full website test again, fixed last-minute bugs, and cleaned up both frontend and backend code.

Day 29

I deployed my frontend on GitHub Pages and backend on Render. I tested the live version to make sure everything works online.

Day 30

Today was the final day. I wrote a report about everything I did, added screenshots of the project, and gave a demo of how my website works. I also explained what I learned during this journey.

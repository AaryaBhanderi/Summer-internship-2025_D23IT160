Day 1

I began my internship by learning what I had to do: build a movie ticket booking website. I listed out the features I wanted, like showing movies, viewing movie details, booking tickets, selecting seats, and creating an admin panel to manage movies.

Day 2

I drew a rough sketch of how my website will have a homepage, movie details page, seat booking, and admin panel. It helped me visualize the structure.

Day 3

I created folders for my project and added HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. I also installed Node.js and Express to set up my backend and created a sample movies.json file.

Day 4

I designed the homepage using HTML and CSS. I added a few hardcoded movie cards to test how they look on the screen.

Day 5

I created the movie.html page to show the full details of a selected movie. I also added some sample content for now.

Day 6

I started building the backend using Node.js and Express. I created APIs to send movie data from the movies.json file to the frontend.

Day 7

I connected the frontend with the backend using fetch() in JavaScript. Now, the movie list on the homepage is coming from the backend.

Day 8

I made the movie cards dynamic. They now display based on the data from the backend. Clicking a card takes the user to the movie details page.

Day 9

I worked on movie.html to show details of the selected movie using URL parameters and JavaScript. I also added showtime selection.

Day 10

I built the seat selection layout using buttons for seats. Clicking on a seat changes its color to show it’s selected.

Day 11

I made a booking summary page that shows movie name, showtime, selected seats, and total cost after seat selection.

Day 12

I created login and signup pages. I used localStorage to store user information since I’m not using a real database.

Day 13

I used CSS media queries to make the website look good on phones and tablets. Now it’s responsive.

Day 14

I tested the site like a user. I clicked all buttons, tested the forms, and fixed small layout issues and bugs.

Day 15

I worked on improving the backend. I made sure /movies and /movies/:id APIs return correct data by reading from the JSON file.

Day 16

I added a new API for booking. It stores selected seats and movie info into a JSON file when a user confirms booking.

Day 17

I updated the system to remember booked seats and show them as unavailable next time the same movie is booked.
